# SIMPLE LOGIN PAGE
The login page is used for authentication purposes in the applications. We required a firstly sign-up page where users will register themselves and will be able to log in further using a username and password

In this project, we have created a simple login page in the android studio where the authentication purpose is static, meaning the username and password will already be set in the code. With the same set of usernames and passwords, the user has to log in.
